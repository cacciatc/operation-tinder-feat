=====================

This was my submission for Ludum Dare 23.

Armed with a water gun and candy rations, seek out and free captured soliders hidden throughout the neighborhood north of 40th st.

Now listen carefully:
The rumors are true--
Northern Command was defeated this morning.  The Coalition of Gated Communities routed our forces scattering them throughout the
territory north of 40th st.  Intelligence reports that a large of number of our soliders were taken prisioner.  With Sourthern Command
firmly entrenched in the Public Pool Conflict we have no man power available to take care of our POWS.  

We need your special skills and experience now to free these soliders.  Infiltrate the Northern territory.  Find our men and bring them home.

You will be without help, alone in hostile lands.

Good luck.
